For the Capstone Project the analyst has chosen data from Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) for the month of April 2025 and for the month-to-month comparison the author has also chosen the data for the month of March 2025.  This data is collected by the National Health Service Business Service Authority (NHSBSA) and it contains the monthly administrative data. The PCA data holds evidence on all prescription’s items dispensed in the community in England monthly and submitted to the NHSBSA for repayment. PCA delivers information of the costs and volumes of all prescriptions dispensed at the community in England. 
Background:
This data reflects the methodology used in the PCA annual national statistics publication. PCA demonstrates the total volume and cost for drugs, dressings, appliances, and medical devices that have been dispensed in the community in England. These statistics are created to assemble the total number of prescription items and spend for any individual product, at any level of the British National Formulary (BNF) hierarchy, e.g. for Paracetamol 500mg tablets, or collections of products such as antibacterial drugs, antidepressant drugs, or dressings.
Prescription data is collected by the NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) for the operational drive of recompensing dispensing contractors for the costs of supplying drugs and devices, and providing essential and advanced services, to NHS patients in different Integrated Care Board (ICB) or region. This data is used to monitor medicine uptake, to allow public scrutiny of prescribing habits, to inform local and national policy, and in academic research.
Data is collected from the submission of prescriptions by dispensing contractors to the NHSBSA. These prescriptions are issued by GPs and other authorised prescribers such as nurses, dentists, and allied health professionals. Prescriptions that are issued by hospitals can also be dispensed in the community and submitted for reimbursement. Prescriptions that are issued in hospitals and fulfilled by the hospital pharmacy or dispensary are not included in this data.
The dataset contains prescription records, with fields such as:
o	Date (Year, Month)
o	Region (Region Name, ICB-Name)
o	Practice type (Dispenser, account, Type)
o	Drug details (chemical/substance name, strength, formulation)
o	Supplier
o	BNF (classification: therapeutic category hierarchy)

Aim and Objectives:
The aim of the project is the better understanding of the PCA data and to understand the data subsequent objectives will be followed:  
	Identifying the most frequently prescribed medications in each Integrated Care Board (ICB) or region.
	How does prescription frequency change from March 2025 to April 2025?
	How often are generics used instead of brand names? Are some Integrated Care Board (ICBs) better at switching to generics?
	Are some medications more prescribed in certain regions despite similar demographics?

Conclusion: This project aimed to explore, analyse, and visualise NHS prescription patterns across regions and Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) in England. Using detailed monthly data, several key insights were uncovered regarding medication usage, regional spending, prescribing behaviours.
